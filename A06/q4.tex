Considering the given primal LP, we can construct the dual LP using the rules prescribed in the slides as; \\

\begin{align}
    \text{maximize } &p'c \notag\\
    \text{subject to } &p \ge 0 \notag\\
                    &p'A \le c \notag
\end{align}

We must show that $x^*$ is an optimal solution if $Ax^*=c$ and $x\geq 0$. Since $x^*$ satisfies these constraints, it is a feasible solution to the primal (original) LP problem.

We note that since $A$ is symmetric and square, $A=A'$ and

\[Ax^*=A'x^*=(x^*)'A=c\]

Since $x^*\geq 0$, $x^*$ is also a feasible solution to the dual problem. It's cost in the dual problem is

\[c'x^* = (x^*)'c \text{ as a scalar and its transpose are equal}\]

Thus, $x^*$ is a feasible solution in the primal and the dual, with the same cost in both probmems. Strong duality suggests that $x^*$ is thus an optimal solution in the primal (original) problem.
