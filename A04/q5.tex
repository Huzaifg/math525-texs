\subsection*{a}
The question asks for values of the unknowns to be such that the current solution is optimal and there are multiple optimal solutions. \\

We can see that $\bar{c}_2$ is negative. Therefore, for the current basic feasible solution to be optimal, we need a degenerate basic feasible solution (Theorem 3.1). Thus, we set $\beta$ to $0$. We also need to transform the tableau such that we have a new bases (and thus multiple bases) and end up with the same basic feasible solution. Thus, we should have $\theta^*$ to be $0$. For this we require $\eta$ to be $\le 0$ so that the pivot row is $3$ (costs row is row 0). We also want the pivot column to be column $2$ as for the algorithm to terminate, we need all the reduced costs to be non-negative. Thus we choose $\delta = 0$. Additionally, during transformations, we want the $\delta$ to stay at 0 or become positive. We thus choose $\gamma = 0$. This leaves us with $\alpha$ which can be anything. Thus with the choices $\boldsymbol{\beta = 0,\: \delta = 0.\: \gamma = 0,\: \text{and}\: \eta \le 0}$, we let $x_2$ enter the basis and obtain $\theta^* = \dfrac{\beta}{3} = 0$ and we stay at the same basic feasible solution but with a different basis. Also, we make $\bar{c}_2$ as 0 and the algorithm terminates as all $\bar{c}_j$ are non-negative. 



\subsection*{b}
The optimal cost is $- \infty$ if we choose a $j$ for which $\bar{c}_j < 0$ and all of the $u$'s in column $j$ are positive. Based on the available unknowns, we can only make column $1$ such that all the $u$'s are positive. We thus choose $\boldsymbol{\delta < 0}$ and ensure that we choose the minimum index pivoting rule. Then we set $\boldsymbol{\alpha \le 0 \text{ and } \gamma \le 0}$. Then, when we attempt to bring $x_1$ into the basis, we see that the optimal cost is $- \infty$.

\subsection*{c}
The current solution is not optimal if it is non degenerate since we have a $\bar{c}_j < 0$. Thus by setting $\boldsymbol{\beta > 0}$, we obtain a feasible but not optimal solution.
